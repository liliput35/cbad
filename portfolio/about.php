                <p class="">Hi, my name is Lorenz Nicolas Ciocon. I'm currently in third year college studying for a Computer Science degree in Bacolod City, Philippines. I started learning frontend development by myself with the help of youtube and online courses such as the Javascript and React courses on Scrimba. I've also gained experience in C++ and Java Object Oriented Programming through school by making various projects such as 2D games, and other GUI based systems.</p>
